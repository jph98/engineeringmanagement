Look at the "consultants" bastardisation of agile to suit their own purposes

* Understand consultants masquerading as "agile experts" treating the software and teams as a black box

Principle: Understand the difference between the development methodology and the principals

Principle Don't cargo cult from principles that have been described as "proven to work with others, e.g:

* The Spotify Model

What works for others, doesn't necessarily work for you.

Principle: Adopt pragmatic agile methodologies 

* Use change management to work out what works for you 
* Adopt retrospectives
* Reject zealots who say this "practice" has to work
