# Architecture

We follow the current practices:

* Architecture Definition Records
* Fornightly meeting to discuss architecture

Principles

* We identify ASR's early on in projects - https://thesoftarch.com/identify-architecture-significant-requirement-asr/
* We create spike's for risky or ambiguous problems
* We challenge a proposed design, but we don't criticise the author, we aim to make it better
* We follow simplicity over complexity - https://medium.com/better-programming/simplicity-over-complexity-8b4172fd5e8b
