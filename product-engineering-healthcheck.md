## Product/Engineering Health Check

![healthcheck](health-check.png)

* 1 - 2   Poor, We don’t do this, or we do it very poorly, needs major improvement
* 3 - 4   Not Great, We’re really not great at this
* 5 - 6   Ok, We do things well, but there are areas that need improvement which we’re aware of
* 7 - 9   Good, We’re good at this, there’s few areas in which we could improve
* 10      Amazing, We’re really great at this

## Area 1: Roadmap and Prioritisation 

### Product Roadmap

- Does a product roadmap exist?
- How well do we break product roadmap items down into actionable work?
- Do we involve multiple roles in this process (PM’s, engineers)?

### Platform Roadmap

- Does a platform roadmap exist for the product detailing how it will evolve?
- How do you record and model large technical debt items?
- Do you have a process for monitoring technology trends, evaluating and adopting technology for competitive advantage?

### Prioritisation Meeting

- Do you hold prioritisation meetings to discuss and negotiate product and platform items?
- Do you have a standard prioritisation technique for product items?

## Area 2: Team Roles

- Do product managers attend daily meetings?
- Do QA’s, product managers and engineers discuss work prior to development (via a refinement meeting or other)?
- Do QA’s product managers and engineers attend planning sessions for development?

## Area 3: Specification

### Delivery

- Do product managers work with engineers and QA’s to ensure work is well structured to the appropriate level?
- Do work items change frequently during the development cycle?
- Is it clear what needs to be tested when work items are complete?
- Do people test their own work or do they seek help from a peer or a dedicated QA?

### DEEP Backlog

- Is your backlog for each team DEEP detailed appropriately (with respect of detail for upcoming work), estimated and prioritised?

### Definition of Ready

- Is there a “Definition of Ready” for work specification that defines what the development team need prior to work starting?

### Specification Refinement

- Do you hold meetings to understand and break down large items of work into smaller, actionable pieces of work?

### Work Structure

- Do your stories have a standard structure?
- Do you document assumptions and risks?
- Do you have clear acceptance criteria for signing work off?
- Do you include technical considerations with respect to non-functional attributes in the work items?
- Does work follow the INVEST mnemonic (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable) or a similar standard?

## Area 4: Completion

### Definition of Done

- Is there a definition of done for the team that is used to ensure work is completed according to a standard?

### Demo and Success

- Do you hold demos/reviews of the completed functionality?
- Does the team celebrate success for completed work?

### Change Management

- Do you meet to discuss problems with development, specification or the team?
- Do you hold retrospective to understand how you can improve as a team?
- Are there clear outcomes from the retrospectives that you attempt to improve on?
